    Welcome
    Welcome to The E.N.D
    Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
    Everything around you is changing
    Nothing stays the same
    This version of myself is not permanent
    Tomorrow, I will be different
    The energy never dies
    Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
    It always is, and it always will be
    This is the end, and the beginning..
    Forever infinite
    Welcome
